# IE0005-Predicting-Cardiovascular-Disease

## Introduction
IE0005 is an introductory module to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. This final project concludes the module and aims to predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases through patients' lifestyle habits. The data set is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset). This project is done with the help of 2 other groupmates.

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Application of Machine Learning Models
   - Naive Bayes
   - K-Nearest Neigbors (KNN)
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

### Conclusions
Out of the 3 machine learning models implemented, SVM classifier model performed the best with ~72.7% accuracy. However, it is important to note that such accuracy is insufficient and further improvements are ereuired for impplementatin in the medical context.
